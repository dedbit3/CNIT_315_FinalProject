# CNIT_315_FinalProject
CNIT 315 final project creating a ransomware virus

NOTES:
- The smaller more consice, fast and efficient the code the better keep that in mind as you are writing it
- Document your code with comments as you write it so we don't get lost (the compiler won't compile the binary with comments any way)
- Feel free to experiment though, if you want to branch main and try something go ahead
- Name your commits briefly with a good description as this will make it easier to figure out what was changed and make tracking commits easier
- if you get a segfault use GDB

(I might update this as we continue with the project lmao)
(if you guys have any suggestions too)
